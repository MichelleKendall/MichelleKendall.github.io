[![CRAN Status Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/phyloTop)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=phyloTop)
[![CRAN Downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/phyloTop)](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/phyloTop/index.html)

In December 2015 I began maintenance of the package *phyloTop* for exploring topological properties of trees. 
It includes functions to calculate tree summary statistics (imbalance, depth, configurations sizes etc.), visualisation tools for highlighting topological properties of a tree in a plot (cherries, subtrees, ladders etc.) and tools for simulating an epidemic and its corresponding transmission genealogy. 

It can be found <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phyloTop/index.html" target="_blank">here on CRAN</a> and can be installed and loaded by typing
```
install.packages("phyloTop")

library(phyloTop)
```

The development version can be found <a href="https://github.com/MichelleKendall/phyloTop" target="_blank">here on GitHub</a> and installed and loaded using
```
devtools::install_github("michellekendall/phyloTop")

library(phyloTop)
```

Below is an example from the package. The command
```
subtreeShow(rtree(20), nodeList=c(23,35), mainCol="navy", 
        subtreeCol="cyan", nodeLabelCol="cyan", edge.width=2)
```
plots a random tree with 20 tips, and highlights in cyan the subclade(s) descending from internal nodes 23 and 35.
