*treespace* is an R package for statistical exploration of landscapes of phylogenetic trees. 
(Note, it was previously released with the name "treescape".) 
It includes a <a href="http://shiny.imperial-stats-experimental.co.uk/users/mlkendal/treespace" target="_blank">shiny app</a> which provides a simple user interface for the functions. 
To install and load it, simply run (in R > 3.2.2):
```
install.packages("treespace")
library(treespace)
```
