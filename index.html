				<p class="editable">
				  I specialise in developing and communicating statistical methods, software and results for public health protection.
				  <br />
					<br />
					
				  I am a Senior Researcher in the 
				  <a href="https://www.psi.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Pandemic Sciences Institute</a> 
				  at the University of Oxford, working in 
				  <a href="https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/christophe-fraser" target="_blank">Professor Christophe Fraser</a>'s group on the CEPI-funded
				  <a href="https://045.medsci.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">PRESTO project</a> 
				  which aims to accelerate the start of vaccine effectiveness trials in the event of an epidemic.

				<h2 class="editable">Previously</h2>
				<p class="editable">
				  
				  From early 2020 I was involved in the motivation, design, maintenance and evaluation of the 
				  <a href="https://covid19.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">NHS COVID-19 app</a>. 
				  A summary of the work can be found 
				   <a href="https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/research/pathogen-dynamics/covid" target="_blank">here</a>. 
				   
				  <br />
					<br />
				  Since its decommission in April 2023, I have continued to be involved in extracting epidemiological insights from the anonymised NHS COVID-19 app data 
				  and advocating for the use of Digital Contact Tracing for mitigation and monitoring of future epidemics.
				  
				  For this work I was based first at the <a href="https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Oxford Big Data Institute</a> and then in the 
				  Health Protection Research Unit in Genomics and Enabling Data at the 
				  <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/hpruged/" target="_blank">University of Warwick</a>,
				  working closely with NHS Test and Trace and the 
				  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-health-security-agency" target="_blank">UK Health Security Agency</a>.
				
				  
				  <br />

					My first PostDoc was in the 
					<a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/biomathematics-group" target="_blank">biomathematics group</a> 
					at 
					<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Imperial College London</a>
					with 
					<a href="https://www.sfu.ca/math/department/faculty/colijn--caroline.html" target="_blank">Caroline Colijn</a>, 
					where we developed methods and software for comparing 
					<a href="https://michellekendall.github.io/publications/#tree_section">evolutionary trees</a>.
				<br />
				<br />

				My PhD was in Information Security at 
				<a href="hhttps://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Royal Holloway</a>, 
				University of London, with 
				<a href="https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/keith-m-martin(ffa7fb4d-3b17-40ca-96cd-48600a0ae84f).html" target="_blank">Keith Martin</a>.
				I used combinatorial and probabilistic methods to answer questions about 
				<a href="https://michellekendall.github.io/publications/#key_section">how to distribute cryptographic keys</a> 
				to secure networks of small devices.

				<h2 class="editable">When I'm not working</h2>
				<p class="editable">
				I seem to spend most of my free time taking turns with
				<a href="https://twitter.com/dredkendall" target="_blank"> my husband </a>
				to either do chores or entertain our two young children.
				As they grow up I am beginning to reclaim a little time for my hobbies: playing piano and violin,
				knitting (yes, that's a binary tree I knitted),
				hiking, pub quizzing, and brewing mead and beer.
