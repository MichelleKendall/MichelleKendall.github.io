				<h2 class="editable">About me</h2>
				<p class="editable">I am a senior researcher in statistical genetics and pathogen dynamics at the <a href="https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Oxford Big Data Institute</a>
					in the <a href="https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/Team/christophe-fraser/" target="_blank">Fraser</a> group. I develop statistical methods to answer questions in epidemiology and big data.
					<br />
					<br />

					I normally work on HIV but in February 2020 I switched to working on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019" target="_blank">COVID-19</a>
					together with colleagues from the Oxford BDI Pathogen Dynamics team.
					We have shown how the epidemic can be sustainably contained if contact tracing is sufficiently fast, efficient and happens at scale, and that this would be achieveable using a smartphone app.
					We also built a simulation tool which helps policy makers and public health strategists to forecast the course of the epidemic in the presence of a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions.
					Full details <a href="https://045.medsci.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">here</a>.
					<br />
					<br />

				My HIV research is concerned with understanding genotypic variation in the virus within and between patients, and how this affects the severity and other features of their disease.

				<h2 class="editable">Previously</h2>
				<p class="editable">I was a postdoc in the <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/biomathematics-group" target="_blank">biomathematics group</a> at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Imperial College London</a>.
				I used mathematical ideas from combinatorics, topology and statistics to explore the complicated world of evolutionary trees.
				<a href="https://www.sfu.ca/math/department/faculty/colijn--caroline.html" target="_blank">Professor Caroline Colijn</a> and I developed a method for comparing phylogenetic trees to reveal distinct evolutionary patterns present in data, which is available in the R package <a href="https://thibautjombart.github.io/treespace/" target="_blank"><i>treespace</i></a>.
				<br />
				<br />

				My PhD was in Information Security at <a href="hhttps://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Royal Holloway</a>, University of London, with <a href="https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/keith-m-martin(ffa7fb4d-3b17-40ca-96cd-48600a0ae84f).html" target="_blank">Professor Keith Martin</a>.
				I used combinatorial and probabilistic methods to answer questions about how to distribute cryptographic keys to secure networks of small devices.

				<h2 class="editable">When I'm not working</h2>
				<p class="editable">
				At the moment I seem to spend most of my free time taking turns with
				<a href="https://twitter.com/dredkendall" target="_blank"> my husband </a>
				to either do chores or entertain our two young children.
				As they grow up I am beginning to reclaim a little time for my hobbies: playing piano and violin,
				knitting (yes, that's a binary tree I knitted),
				hiking, pub quizzing, and brewing mead and beer.
